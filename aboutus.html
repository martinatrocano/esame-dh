          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>The photos of artworks collected by Carlo Volpe are part of the Fototeca Supino which was founded by
            scholar
            Igino Benvenuto Supino in collaboration with the Istituto di Storia dell’Arte of the University of Bologna.
            Essential documents and tools for the art history’s research, the archive now counts 71000 photographs
            divided
            into 4 sections: Fototeca Supino, Archivio Croci, Fototeca Volpe and Miscellanea Istituto di Storia
            dell'Arte.
            Due to complexity and breadth of the collection, we selected a specific topic investigated by Carlo Volpe
            with
            his photographic collection: the Bolognese artistic production in the Trecento. As a result, our
            digitalization campaign focused on cataloguing six folders in the collection related to that topic. We
            planned
            our project in stages, dividing ourselves into working teams based on the tasks we needed to complete:
            - Researching the bibliography using volumes and books in the Supino Library and in the Fondazione Zeri;
            - Managing the digitization process using a specific scanning machine;
            - Organizing the cataloguing process referring to specific standards with the platform Archiui;
            - Conceiving the curatorial project for the digital exhibition;
            - Organizing a communication campaign on social media for monitoring our work.
            Conservation
            The primary source for our project were the real photos that are conserved and preserved in the archive
            respecting their nature of fragile objects. The pictures were originally inventoried and catalogued with the
            insertion of a specific inventory number that reveals the photos’ current location in the Fototeca. The
            disposition of each photo reflects the archive's organization which we must take in mind during the
            digitization process. Pictures were placed in acid-free folders and boxes and kept in an air-conditioned
            room
            to maintain the proper temperature and humidity for conservation.
            When starting to digitize photos, we must assure that we handle these materials with care, wearing cotton
            gloves.
            Digitalization
            The digitization process must be very precise. Each photo was scanned by us using a specific scanning
            machine
            which creates a digital copy of the analogue photograph that must be reproduced in both its recto and verso.
            When the digital copy was saved in the PC, the post-production and quality control work began, adhering to a
            set of reference standards and parameters. The master file of the photo was saved reporting its cataloguing
            number and in parallel catalogued in the content management system we chose for managing the documents:
            Archiui.
            Cataloguing with Archiui
            Archiui is the first digital platform dedicated to historical archives. Developed by Promemoria, its main
            goal
            is to organize and enhance the historical and cultural heritage of brands, companies and institutions. The
            platform follows the analysis and arrangement of heritage into categories, and then develops organization
            systems and vocabularies tailored to each institution.
            Archiui gave us the possibility to arrange the inventory, in which we created the virtual versions of the
            physical folders; in each of them, we uploaded all the previously scanned works, in the forms of “Scheda
            opera” and “Scheda foto” (see Appendix 1). Within the “Scheda opera” we have placed all the entries with
            information regarding the work, such as author, year, location, type of work, materials used etc. While in
            the
            "Scheda foto" we have included all the entries related to the photograph itself, such as identification,
            type
            of photograph, author, year, etc.
            Based on collective access, Archiui allowed us to build up connections between the different items, and
            helped
            us in rendering the system of the works relations.
            The cataloguing part is carried out in the back end of Archiui, and it is where the digitized works took
            shape. The user will then be able to visualize the catalogued photographs in the front end section of the
            site. The user will then be able to view the cataloged photographs in the frontend section of the site. In
            this section it is possible to browse through the catalogued collections and folders, letting oneself be
            inspired by the images in the archive.
            Social Media/Communication
            The Instagram page has been used to share and promote the work gathered by the students during the
            laboratory
            of Valorisation of Medieval and Modern Art. During the first part of the course, we considered international
            museums’ social media strategies and the latest innovations in promotion in cultural heritage since the
            spreading of social media. In our Instagram page, we have tried to apply some of these strategies to the
            project on Carlo Volpe’s archive.

            <p>
            The structure of the Instagram Page has been conceived with the aim to be visually coherent and pleasing for
            users. A common graphic and a logo have been created in order to present a unique style for the feed. As for
            the posts, they focused both on the content of the online exhibition on Archui and the documentation of the
            activities carried by the students during classes, specifically the work of digitalization of the Carlo
            Volpe’s archive.
            Interviews with students and professors were included in the feed, aiming to share diverse points of view
            about the importance of valorisation and digitization of cultural heritage.
            The instagram feed has been divided into three visual columns: the one on the right gathers has been
            dedicated
            to interviews with professors and professionals in the field of Medieval Art History.
            The central one has been completely dedicated to the work of digitalization of the archive, showing the
            process needed for the digitalization of a photo archive. At last, the one on the left has been opened to
            students’ sharing their experience and thoughts about the link between valorization and digitalization of
            the
            archive.
          </p>

            <p>
            Through the Instagram stories, we tried to boost users’ curiosity by posting quizzes about works from the
            Carlo Volpe’s archive and photos showing the students working in class.
