          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <h4>Laboratory</h4>
          <p>The laboratory, taken by Professor Gianluca del Monaco after the theoretical lessons, provided us an
            excellent occasion to put into practice the principles of archival funds management that we had learned in
            class. Indeed, the laboratory’s goal was to digitize, catalogue and valorize through the creation of a
            digital exhibition a portion of Professor and Art Historian Carlo Volpe’s photographic collection, housed in
            the archival collection of “I.B. Supino Library” in Santa Cristina Complex in Bologna.
          </p>
          <h4>Carlo Volpe’s Photographic Collection
          </h4>
          <p> The photos of artworks collected by Carlo Volpe are part of the Fototeca Supino which was founded by
            scholar Igino Benvenuto Supino in collaboration with the Istituto di Storia dell’Arte of the University of
            Bologna. Essential documents and tools for the art history’s research, the archive now counts 71000
            photographs divided into 4 sections: Fototeca Supino, Archivio Croci, Fototeca Volpe and Miscellanea
            Istituto di Storia dell'Arte.
          </p>
          <p>Due to complexity and breadth of the collection, we selected a specific topic investigated by Carlo Volpe
            with his photographic collection: the Bolognese artistic production in the Trecento. As a result, our
            digitalization campaign focused on cataloguing six folders in the collection related to that topic.
            We planned our project in stages, dividing ourselves into working teams based on the tasks we needed to
            complete:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Researching the bibliography using volumes and books in the Supino Library and in the Fondazione Zeri;
            </li>
            <li>Managing the digitization process using a specific scanning machine;</li>
            <li>Organizing the cataloguing process referring to specific standards with the platform Archiui;</li>
            <li> Conceiving the curatorial project for the digital exhibition;</li>
            <li>Organizing a communication campaign on social media for monitoring our work.</li>

          <h4>Conservation</h4>
          <p>The primary source for our project were the real photos that are conserved and preserved in the archive
            respecting their nature of fragile objects. The pictures were originally inventoried and catalogued with the
            insertion of a specific inventory number that reveals the photos’ current location in the Fototeca. The
            disposition of each photo reflects the archive's organization which we must take in mind during the
            digitization process. Pictures were placed in acid-free folders and boxes and kept in an air-conditioned
            room to maintain the proper temperature and humidity for conservation.
            When starting to digitize photos, we must assure that we handle these materials with care, wearing cotton
            gloves.
          </p>
          <h4>Digitalization</h4>
          <p>The digitization process must be very precise. Each photo was scanned by us using a specific scanning
            machine which creates a digital copy of the analogue photograph that must be reproduced in both its recto
            and verso. When the digital copy was saved in the PC, the post-production and quality control work began,
            adhering to a set of reference standards and parameters. The master file of the photo was saved reporting
            its cataloguing number and in parallel catalogued in the content management system we chose for managing the
            documents: Archiui.
          </p>
          <h4>Cataloguing with Archiui
          </h4>
          <p>Archiui is the first digital platform dedicated to historical archives. Developed by Promemoria, its main
            goal is to organize and enhance the historical and cultural heritage of brands, companies and institutions.
            The platform follows the analysis and arrangement of heritage into categories, and then develops
            organization systems and vocabularies tailored to each institution.
            Archiui gave us the possibility to arrange the inventory, in which we created the virtual versions of the
            physical folders; in each of them, we uploaded all the previously scanned works, in the forms of “Scheda
            opera” and “Scheda foto” (see Appendix 1). Within the “Scheda opera” we have placed all the entries with
            information regarding the work, such as author, year, location, type of work, materials used etc. While in
            the "Scheda foto" we have included all the entries related to the photograph itself, such as identification,
            type of photograph, author, year, etc.
            Based on collective access, Archiui allowed us to build up connections between the different items, and
            helped us in rendering the system of the works relations.
            The cataloguing part is carried out in the back end of Archiui, and it is where the digitized works took
            shape. The user will then be able to visualize the catalogued photographs in the front end section of the
            site. The user will then be able to view the cataloged photographs in the frontend section of the site. In
            this section it is possible to browse through the catalogued collections and folders, letting oneself be
            inspired by the images in the archive.

          <h4>Social Media Communication</h4>
          <p>The Instagram page has been used to share and promote the work gathered by the students during the
            laboratory of Valorisation of Medieval and Modern Art. During the first part of the course, we considered
            international museums’ social media strategies and the latest innovations in promotion in cultural heritage
            since the spreading of social media. In our Instagram page, we have tried to apply some of these strategies
            to the project on Carlo Volpe’s archive.
          </p>
          <p>The structure of the Instagram Page has been conceived with the aim to be visually coherent and pleasing
            for users. A common graphic and a logo have been created in order to present a unique style for the feed. As
            for the posts, they focused both on the content of the online exhibition on Archui and the documentation of
            the activities carried by the students during classes, specifically the work of digitalization of the Carlo
            Volpe’s archive.
          </p>
          <p>Interviews with students and professors were included in the feed, aiming to share diverse points of view
            about the importance of valorisation and digitization of cultural heritage.
          </p>
          <p>The instagram feed has been divided into three visual columns: the one on the right gathers has been
            dedicated to interviews with professors and professionals in the field of Medieval Art History.

          <h2>Exhibition</h2>
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Carlo Volpe Archive 2020 aims to take advantage of all the opportunities that the online archive offers in
            terms of fruition. The virtual space facilitates the access to contents since the audience can benefit from
            a well-organized catalogue of items browsing all the different entries. Moreover, the user experience design
            of Archiui allows to explore the archive from different perspectives thanks to tools like timelines and
            maps. The most interesting instrument provided by Archiui (and other CMS) is the possibility of creating a
            virtual exhibition to valorise the archive enhancing specific aspects of the collection. The tool of
            storytelling turns out to be extremely effective since it transforms the archive from a “pure catalogue”
            into a captivating and engaging experience. This approach provides users with a narrative and encourages
            them to navigate the archive with a critical point of view.
          </p>
          <p>Art historian’s archives are complex by nature since they usually are an active instrument of study and
            research. Therefore, the options of narrative are often multiple and variegated. This paper aims to analyse
            the virtual exhibition section of Carlo Volpe Archive 2020 and illustrate the choices made in matters of
            storytelling. Specifically, the essay will consider the target, the subjects selected and the curatorial
            approach.
          </p>
          <h4>Target</h4>
          <p>When it came to organizing and planning the exhibition on the Archiui web site, one of the first things we
            discussed was the target audience. Given the nature of the archive and the items it displays, the most
            natural choice was to address the exhibition to an audience that was already interested in the subject.
            Indeed, the archive presenting historical photos of medieval art objects can be an interesting source for
            research in the field. Nonetheless, we did not want to exclude a wider public from enjoying the exhibition.
            In the catalogue, we have tried to use simple and clear language, with explanations that can be understood
            even by those who are not in the field. Moreover, within the structure of the Archiui website, it was
            possible to create a section “Historytelling” for in-depth studies outside the exhibition layout. In this
            section of the site, two types of content have been created: "Spin-offs" for a visitor curious about
            different types of topics such as fashion, iconography, photography; and "Getting to know" to introduce the
            curators.
          </p>
          <h4>Subject/Contents
          </h4>
          <p>The rationale behind the curatorial choices that support the exhibition has been Carlo Volpe’s essay La
            Pittura del Trecento in Emilia e in Romagna (1980). This work has been a key text to reconstruct the history
            of Bolognese Trecento painting, since it gave historical consistency to an artistic period which had been
            previously rediscovered thanks to Volpe’s master, Roberto Longhi. Following Volpe’s analysis, the exhibition
            features a selection of six masterpieces of the Trecento Bolognese:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> the frescoes in San Giacomo Maggiore
            </li>
            <li>the polyptych (1333-34) by Giotto, in the Pinacoteca di Bologna
            </li>
            <li>the triptych by the Master of 1333
            </li>
            <li> Vitale’s Saint George and the dragon
            </li>
            <li>Vitale’s frescoes from Mezzaratta
            </li>
            <li>the Crucifixion by Pseudo-Dalmasio, in the Pinacoteca di Bologna
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Photographs reproducing each painting have been selected from one of the six photographic folders from the
            Fototeca Carlo Volpe. With this choice we aimed to chronologically reconstruct the Bolognese pictorial
            development in the fourteenth century, while providing a concise but comprehensive overview of the main
            characters in this artistic chapter. However, the focus of the exhibition was not only the pictorial
            evolution in the Bolognese context, but more specifically the relevance of Volpe’s examinations for the
            developing of the art-historical critique. Hence, in the exhibition, each section opens with a quote from
            Volpe’s essay related to a specific work of art, in order to highlight the pivotal role of the art historian
            in the critical re-evaluation of the Bolognese artistic landscape. Likewise, the panels feature the coloured
            pictures of the selected Bolognese artworks along with the related black-and-white photographs from Carlo
            Volpe’s archive that we have scanned and catalogued during the laboratory.
